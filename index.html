		<p class="para1">The Padma Multipurpose Bridge is the longest bridge in Bangladesh. On June 25, 2022, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the largest infrastructure in the country. The bridge is mainly constructed with steel and concrete. This great Padma Bridge was actually a dream to the people of Bangladesh. Ultimately, Bangladesh successfully implemented this biggest project without any foreign investment.</p>

		<p id="para2">The name of my nation is Bangladesh. Its location in eastern South Asia borders the Bay of Bengal in the south, India, Myanmar, and simply India to the east and west. Its total area, including waterways, is 147,570 square kilometers. It won its freedom following a bloody liberation conflict. Three million men and women have sacrificed their lives for independence. The newly formed country faced many hurdles and harsh times after gaining independence. It does, however, rise well. Today, Bangladesh ranks among the best countries in South Asia to live in. In our country, there are many breathtaking locations to visit. Bangladesh is a small country. But it has a sizable population. About 120 million individuals call this little nation home. The population density in this area is high. Approximately 800 people call a square kilometer home. Bangladesh is primarily agricultural, with farmers making up most of the population. It is still a charming and serene country, though. Bangladeshis are extraordinarily kind to one another.</p>
